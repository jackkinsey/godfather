Project 4/5
Due 4/25/17
200 pts.

• My Godfather (the Don, Michael Corleone) is the head of a major
corporation that deals with olive oil imports from Sicily, legalized personal
companionship, distilleries, and legal casinos gambling
• His corporation (families) interest span the United States from N.Y. N.J.
Chicago, and Kansas City to name a few.
• Because the Don is a “Family” man and wants to personally talk with the
CEOs of his interests together (and separately- when need be ) for security
reasons he has decided to build an airport that will accommodate both
commercial and business travel

• You are to create an automatic Air Traffic Control System that manages two runways
• Each runway is capable of landing aircraft and allowing aircraft to take of
• Planes that wish to take of will specify the amount of fuel they currently
have, the cost of their cargo, number of persons on board, and if a “family”
member is onboard
• Planes must have 20 units of fuel or they are required to go back to the gate
and refuel (10 time units)
• Planes that wish to land will specify the amount of fuel they currently have,
the cost of their cargo, the number of people aboard and if there any
“Grandchildren” aboard (family member).
• Each runway can either land or allow a plane to take of during each time unit

• For this project you are to read from an input file that contains the actions for
the planes to perform.
• The input file is a comma separated values (csv) file with the following format:

Item        Type        Values          Description                                                 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command     Char        D, P, W         D for data, P for print statistics, Wait for carriage return
Time        Integer     >= 0            The relative time of the action
Action      Char        A, D            A: Arrival, D: Departure
Fuel        Integer     >= 0            Amount of fuel the aircraft currently has
People      Integer     >= 0            Number of people on board
Cargo       Float       Currency >= 0   Cargo Value amount
Special     Char        Y, N            Y Grandchild on board N: No Grandchild

• Sample input file:
'''
    D,0,D,100,300,500000.00,N // Data, At time 0, Departure 100 units of fuel, 300 people, 500,000.00 cargo, No Grand

    D, 0,D,90,25,500.00,Y // Data, At time 0, Departure 90 units of fuel, 25 people, 500.00 cargo, Grandchild

    P // Print command. Print the current statistics

    W // Wait for carriage return

    D,0,A,3,300,2500,Y // Data, At time 0, Arrival 3 units of fuel, 300 people, 2500.00 cargo, Grandchild

    D,1,A,2,300,2500,Y // Data, At time 1, Arrival 2 units of fuel, 300 people, 2500.00 cargo, Grandchild

    D,3,A,2,300,2500,N // Data, At time 3, Arrival 2 units of fuel, 300 people, 2500.00 cargo, No Grandchild
'''

• Your program should process the input file and perform the requested action.
• You should keep the following statistics, and display after the file has been processed or on command:
    •Average Take of wait time
    •Average landing wait time
    •Number of plan crash
    •Number of plans departing
    •Number of planes arriving
    •Number of people that landed safely
    •Number of people killed
    •Number of Grandchildren killed
    •Average wait time for a grandchild Arriving or departing. (Dead grandchildren not included)
    •Amount of cargo that landed safely
    •Amount of destroyed Cargo
    •Amount of time it takes to process a input file

• This is a competition project for this class
• For this project you will demonstrate your knowledge of the data structures
we learned about and used in class.
• Your ability to use a “canned” data structure is limited. You must create
your own or use the ones you developed in this class. If you have a question,
ask me……
• You are to create a input file that demonstrate your solution.
• Your input files will be the input into other student solutions.
• You will be given a form to fill out for each file processed

• You will work in an assigned groups of up to 3 students per group
• You will be required to evaluate your teammates’ contribution to the teams
solution

• You are to deliver a Power Point presentation outlining your solution
and results (so that I can present it to Don Corleone)
• You are to deliver your code and presentation via email
• You may be asked to present your presentation to the class
• You are to send me your input test file by TBD
• You are to send me your team membership by TBD

• Depending on your statistics you may meet up with
my friends Peter Clemenza, and Luca Brasi
